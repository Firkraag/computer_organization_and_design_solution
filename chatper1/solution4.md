# Problem
Assume a color display using 8 bits for each of the primary colors (red, green, blue) per pixel and a frame size of 1280 Ã— 1024.
a. What is the minimum size in bytes of the frame buffer to storea frame?
b. How long would it take, at a minimum, for the frame to be sent over a 100
Mbit/s network?

# Solution
a. 1280 * 1024 * 3 = 3932160 bytes
b. 3932160 * 8 / 100 / 1024 / 1024 = 0.3s
